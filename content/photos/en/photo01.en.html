    <p>Using the "Pen tool" of Photoshop, we will trace around the image with a path.</p>
    <p>Based on the path, create a selection and mask it.</p>
    <p>Using the "borderline adjustment brush tool", the hair is masked so as not to feel uncomfortable with a good feeling.</p>

    <p>Since it was possible to clip it, I will synthesize it with a nice touch! (Actually adjusts tone curve, color balance, etc.)</p>

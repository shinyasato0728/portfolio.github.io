    <small>Photoshop</small>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Prepare a cropped image</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_01.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Prepare an image of a woman with a nice feeling that is jumping.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Crop the image</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_02.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Using the "Pen tool" of Photoshop, we will trace around the image with a path.</p>
    <p>Based on the path, create a selection and mask it.</p>
    <p>Using the "borderline adjustment brush tool", the hair is masked so as not to feel uncomfortable with a good feeling.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Prepare an image for scissors</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_03.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>In order to synthesize scissors to a woman, prepare an image holding a scissors for a hairdresser.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Cut scissors</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_04.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Using Pen tool, take a pass so that it feels nice.</p>
    <p>Based on the path, create a selection and mask it.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Combine scissors</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_05.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Once you cut out the scissors, it composes it so that there is no discomfort in the image of the girl.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Add shadows to scissors</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_06.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>As this is still a little uncomfortable, I will make a shadow of scissors.</p>
    <p>Along the shadow of the scissors' original image, make a selection area with a nice touch and make a shadow.</p>
    <p>With a gradation overlay, adjust it so that the upper one becomes slightly transparent.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Adjust the shadow of the scissors</h2>
    <figure >
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_07.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Adjust the shadow of the scissors.</p>
    <p>Adjust the opacity of the layer so that it feels nice.</p>

    <h2 class="post__photos--title">Composite</h2>
    <figure>
      <img class="lazyload" data-src="/images/photos/photo06_08.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>Because it was able to clip and synthesize, I will synthesize it with a good feeling! (Actually adjusts tone curve, color balance, etc.)</p>
